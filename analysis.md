# ðŸ“Š Analysis of DeFi Wallet Credit Scores

This document presents a detailed behavioral analysis of wallets based on the credit scores computed from on-chain transaction activity. The scoring system ranges from **0 to 1000**, and is derived using ratios of key DeFi actions such as deposits, borrows, repayments, and liquidations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Score Distribution (Grouped)

| Credit Score Range | Interpretation                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 0â€“100              | Extremely risky or inactive wallets       |
| 100â€“200            | Very low engagement, likely bots          |
| 200â€“300            | Low deposit/repay activity                |
| 300â€“400            | Moderate risk, limited repayment behavior |
| 400â€“500            | Decent activity but not highly reliable   |
| 500â€“600            | Average reliability, repay activity seen  |
| 600â€“700            | Healthy repayment and borrowing behavior  |
| 700â€“800            | Responsible, low-risk DeFi users          |
| 800â€“900            | Strong behavior, trustworthy borrowers    |
| 900â€“1000           | Exceptional wallets with ideal patterns   |

## Behavioral Observations

### Wallets Scoring 0â€“200:
- **Activity**: Little to no DeFi engagement
- **Patterns**: No deposits or repayments; mostly idle or automated accounts
- **Risk**: Extremely high-risk or inactive users
- **Examples**: Likely bots or dormant wallets

---

### Wallets Scoring 200â€“400:
- **Activity**: Some interaction, possibly limited or one-sided
- **Patterns**: Borrow without repayment, or isolated deposit actions
- **Risk**: Moderate to high-risk behavior
- **Indicators**: Possible opportunistic wallets using DeFi unsustainably

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Wallets Scoring 400â€“600:
- **Activity**: Regular borrowing and some repayments
- **Patterns**: Moderate risk but not severely penalized
- **Behavior**: Users may be improving, or using DeFi cautiously

---

###  Wallets Scoring 600â€“800:
- **Activity**: Balanced borrowing and repayment
- **Patterns**: Responsible usage patterns, low liquidation events
- **Behavior**: Considered reliable users of DeFi protocols
- **Use Case**: Good candidates for credit extensions or loyalty rewards

---

###  Wallets Scoring 800â€“1000:
- **Activity**: High-frequency, reliable engagement
- **Patterns**: Regular deposits, borrowing with consistent repayment, minimal or no liquidation
- **Behavior**: Highly trustworthy
- **Interpretation**: Elite DeFi participants, potentially valuable for whitelisting or governance roles

---

##  Final Remarks

- The model successfully identifies varying tiers of wallet reliability based on transparent on-chain actions.
- The left-skewed nature of the score distribution suggests a **long tail of high-performing users**, but a dense population of lower-engagement wallets.
- This credit scoring framework can be extended or embedded into decentralized lending, access control, or loyalty programs within DeFi ecosystems.
